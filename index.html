Project: Excursion
Comments: very excited to do this project almost from scratch. using the commandline
gives you a feel like you are becoming a programmer! :)

Most of the CSS layout was adapted to tags instead of .classes or #ids.
I don't know if it was the right way but I noticed after the project was almost done.
